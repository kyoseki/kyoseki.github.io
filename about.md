This is the blog page for kyoseki (me, more commonly known as voided or voided_etc) and Fumohouse.
Here, I will ramble about whatever may be on my mind, or post updates on how my projects are going
(assuming I have the time and motivation to do so).

The main project I'm working on now is Fumohouse.
You can check on that through its [Github organization](https://github.com/Fumohouse).

What I say here is not fact, and lots of things are subject to change.

Thanks for reading!
